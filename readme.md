## About
Tabletop Match is an application to find the best board game to buy or play. Based on some filters and questions, gamers will be able to find the best match. They also can build a personal library, add games, remove them, rate them. 

## Technical details
To develop the project, we used AngularJS and Bootstrap. Right now we have a limited “database” of games with around 60 titles. We plan to expand that, and add more information to each game.   

Also, the login is not fully implemented: it's just there to illustrate what changes when you are logged in (you can have your own library, add games to it, rate them, etc.).  

As suggested, we implemented a drag & drop functionality in the library: gamers can create shelves and move games from one to the other using drag & drop. 

To create the sliders in the filters on the left and the drag & drop we used two different libraries developed by other people. They are credited in the respective files.
